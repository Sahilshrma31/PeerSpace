Real-time WebRTC Video Conferencing - PeerSpace
A Feature-Rich Peer-to-Peer Communication Platform
This project, named PeerSpace, is a robust, real-time video conferencing application designed to facilitate seamless peer-to-peer communication, including video calls, integrated chat, screen sharing, and meeting history. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a secure and efficient way for individuals to connect and collaborate online on a local network.

‚ú® Features
Peer-to-Peer Video Calls: High-quality, real-time video and audio communication powered by WebRTC.

Integrated Chat: Text-based chat functionality alongside video calls for concurrent discussions.

Screen Sharing: Share your screen effortlessly to present documents, code, or anything else during a call.

Meeting History: Easily access a record of your past meetings for reference.

Guest Join Option: Join meetings quickly as a guest without needing to create an account.

Intuitive User Interface: A clean and user-friendly design for a smooth communication experience.

üöÄ Technologies Used
This project leverages a powerful combination of technologies to deliver its features:

WebRTC: For real-time communication capabilities (video, audio, screen sharing).

Socket.IO: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and the server for signaling and chat.

MERN Stack:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database for flexible data storage (e.g., meeting history, user data).

Express.js: A back-end web application framework for building RESTful APIs.

React.js: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.

üì¶ Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Sahilshrma31/PeerSpace.git
cd PeerSpace
Install server dependencies:

Bash

cd backend # Assuming your backend code is in a 'backend' folder
npm install
Install client dependencies:

Bash

cd ../frontend # Assuming your frontend code is in a 'frontend' folder
npm install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in your backend directory and add necessary variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, Socket.IO port).

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string # e.g., mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/peerdodb
PORT=5000
Note: Adjust variable names and values based on your actual backend configuration. For local MongoDB, ensure your MongoDB server is running.

üèÉ How to Run
Since this project is primarily set up for local development due to the intricacies of WebRTC deployment, follow these steps to run it on your machine:

Start the backend server:

Bash

cd backend
npm start # Or 'node server.js' depending on your script
The server should start on the port specified in your .env file (e.g., http://localhost:5000).

Start the frontend development server:

Bash

cd ../frontend
npm start
This will usually open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Now you should be able to access the application via http://localhost:3000 and start making video calls locally!
